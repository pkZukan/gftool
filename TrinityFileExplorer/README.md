# Trinity File Explorer
A small utility to explore files inside TRPFS/TRPFD file systems.
Support for GFPAK and TRPAK is in the works.

## Initial Usage
Trinity File Explorer requires ``oo2core_8_win64.dll`` and an up-to-date ``GFPAKHashCache.bin``.
Trinity File Explorer requires you to point it to a valid RomFS folder.

## Updating to the Latest Hashes
If you need update your ``GFPAKHashCache.bin`` you can:
1. Get hashes automatically using ``Help > Load Hashlist > From PokeDocs``
2. Get hashes from a file using ``Help > Load Hashlist > From File``

## Troubleshooting
If you can't find a file, chances are it's not in your GFPAKHashCache, please search for it using the Pack View.
If you can't export files, you're missing ``oo2core_8_win64.dll``.

## Feature Suggestions

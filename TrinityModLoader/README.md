# Trinity Mod Loader
A small utility to make and manage mods for games that use the TRPFS/TRPFD virtual file system (Pokemon Scarlet/Violet and Pokemon Legends Arceus).

## Initial Usage
Trinity Mod Loader requires you to point it to a valid RomFS folder.

## Adding a Mod
1. Add as many mod archive files using the "Add Mod" button. (make sure the contents represent how they would on the romfs)
2. When you're done adding mods, simply hit the "Apply Mods" button. This will generate files either in a LayeredFS folder in the same directory as the program, or a directory of your choice if you set an output directory.
3. Drag and drop the generated files in the output folder into your atmosphere layeredfs directory or your emulator of choice's mod folder.

## Creating a Mod
1. Create a folder and an info.toml file.
1. Extract files using Trinity File Explorer into your mod folder.
3. Add your mod as a folder using the "Add Folder Mod" button and test it ingame.
4. Ship it!
